# Simple Student Information Management System

This is a simple C program that allows you to manage student information using a struct. It takes user input for student details such as name, age, GPA, and faculty and then displays the information in a formatted table.
It's a fun project I created to pass the time and practice my coding skills. ðŸ˜Š

## Usage

1. Enter the number of students you want to manage.

2. Provide the details for each student as prompted.

3. The program will display the student information in a formatted table.

## Example

Here's an example of how the program works:
```markdown
Enter the number of students: 3

Enter the name of student 1: Alice
Enter the age of student 1: 19
Enter the GPA of student 1: 3.5
Enter the faculty of student 1: Engineering

Enter the name of student 2: Bob
Enter the age of student 2: 20
Enter the GPA of student 2: 3.2
Enter the faculty of student 2: Business

Enter the name of student 3: Charlie
Enter the age of student 3: 18
Enter the GPA of student 3: 3.8
Enter the faculty of student 3: Science

_______________________________________________________________

|--------------------|---------|---------|--------------------|
|       Alice        |       19|     3.50|     Engineering    |
|        Bob         |       20|     3.20|      Business      |
|      Charlie       |       18|     3.80|      Computing     |
